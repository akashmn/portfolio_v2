# 🌐 Portfolio Project

This is a personal portfolio website built using **⚛️ React**, **🌌 Three.js**, and **🎨 TailwindCSS (v3.4.x)**.  
It showcases my work, skills, and projects in an interactive and visually engaging way, leveraging 3D elements for a modern experience.

> ⚠️ **Note:** TailwindCSS `^3.4.0` is used in this project.  
> Tailwind v4 introduces a completely different setup, but since this project relies on many v3-specific utilities and configurations, v3 is the recommended choice for stability.

📌 More details about features, sections, and implementation will be added as the project progresses.
